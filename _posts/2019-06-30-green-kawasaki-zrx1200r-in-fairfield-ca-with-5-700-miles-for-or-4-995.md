![A ZRX1200R in amazing condition. Low miles. And green!](/assets/img/uploads/create-a-jekyll-and-netlify-website-zrx1200r-pic-2.jpg "A ZRX1200R in amazing condition. Low miles. And green!")

This Kawasaki ZRX1200R (one of the Eddie Lawson Replica machines) is a current — and definitely future — collector's item.

They very rarely come up for sale, so you should jump on this one. A fair price is closer to $3,000 considering the maintenance work that this will need. You should pay about $4,000 for one with all the proper maintenance done.

Comes with 

* Corbin seat (and original seat)
* Three helmets
* All keys and manuals

It will likely need a new set of front springs, fork oil, braided lines, tyres and of course a [Kerker 4-2-1 exhaust](https://www.ebay.com/b/Kerker-Motorcycle-Exhausts-Exhaust-System-Parts-for-Kawasaki/180027/bn_20329005), standard gear for a Kawasaki 1200R.
